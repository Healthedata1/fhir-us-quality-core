This value set was defined to support identifying any of the possible negation reason codes as part of US Quality Core profiles. The value set exists to support measure developers need to reference medical, patient, and system reasons for processes not performed and it is a grouping of VSAC value sets.  Therefore, retain binding to the US Quality Core value set in the profiles that use the extension.  It only exists to support bindings to capture a reason for negative."
