  * ^comment = "The typical patterns for codes are:  1)  a LOINC code either as a translation from a \"local\" code or as a primary code, or 2)  a local code only if no suitable LOINC exists,  or 3)  both the local and the LOINC translation.

  * ^comment = "At least a date should be present unless this observation is a historical report.  For recording imprecise or \"fuzzy\" times (For example, a blood glucose measurement taken \"after breakfast\") use the [Timing](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#timing) datatype which allow the measurement to be tied to regular life events."
