Title: "US Quality Core Observation Clinical Result"
Description: "This profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource to record and search non-laboratory clinical test results (e.g., radiology and other clinical observations generated from procedures). An example would be when a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy. This profile is the basis for the US Core Clinical Result Profile, which defines additional data elements to record and search laboratory test results."
