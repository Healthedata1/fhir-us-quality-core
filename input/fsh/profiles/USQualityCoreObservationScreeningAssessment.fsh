Title: "US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment"
Description: "The US Quality Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile is based upon the US Core Observation Screening Assessment Profile which can be used to represent individual responses, panels of multi-question surveys, and multi-select responses to “check all that apply” questions. The US Quality Core Observation Survey Profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation Resource to record, search, and fetch retrieve observations that represent the questions and responses to form/survey and defines the core set of elements and extensions for quality rule and measure authors."
