This page lists the change history for each version of **US Quality Core**. 

### Version 1.0.0-ballot

{: #v1.0.0}

Version 1.0.0-ballot establishes US Quality Core as an STU 1.0.0-ballot release for implementing USCDI+ Quality V2 in FHIR R4. This version updates the 2026 US Quality Core Implementation Guide, which
was based on <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU6/">QI-Core v6.0.0</a>
and <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/">US Core v6.1.0</a>, to a
foundation based on <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/2025Sep/">QI-Core
v8.0.0-ballot</a>. Because QI-Core v8.0.0-ballot was developed against US Core
v8.0.0, this guide also updates its direct US Core dependency and profile
alignment to <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU9/">US Core v9.0.0</a>.

The following changes have been made for 1.0.0-ballot from the 2026 US Quality Core IG:

* Updates US Quality Core profiles and resources to derive from, or align with, QI-Core v8.0.0-ballot profiles and resources where possible
* Updates US Quality Core US Core dependency to v9.0.0
* Updates USCDI+ Quality mapping guidance to reflect USCDI+ Quality V2
* Replaces legacy locally-carried US Core terminology artifacts with references to upstream US Core artifacts where possible, leaving only terminology introduced by US Quality Core in this guide
* Converts the maintained IG source to FHIR Shorthand (FSH) for SUSHI-based generation while preserving the generated FHIR artifacts needed by the IG Publisher
* Removes the following US Quality Core profiles and associated artifacts as they do not have USCDI+ Quality mappings:
  * USQualityCoreBodyStructure
  * USQualityCoreClaim
  * USQualityCoreClaimResponse
  * USQualityCoreCommunicationRequest
  * USQualityCoreDeviceUseStatement
  * USQualityCoreFlag
  * USQualityCoreImmunizationEvaluation
  * USQualityCoreImmunizationRecommendation
  * USQualityCoreMedicationStatement
  * USQualityCoreNonPatientObservation
  * USQualityCoreSubstance
  * USQualityCoreFamilyMemberHistory (FamilyMemberHistory added in US Core STU9)
* Removes CQL ModelInfo and supporting artifacts and guidance
* Adds a downloadable USCDI+ Quality data element mappings CSV
* Removes QDM to US Quality Core mapping page

### 2026 US Quality Core IG 

{: #v0.5.0}

The 2026 US Quality Core Implementation Guide v0.5.0 (2026 US Quality Core IG) release is published by ONC through the [FHIR Foundation](https://www.fhir.org/) at [fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0](https://fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0/). Subsequent publications of US Quality Core Implementation Guide are balloted and published through [HL7 International](https://www.hl7.org/).

This section documents the changes from the Quality Improvement Core (QI-Core) Implementation Guide STU 6.0.0 (QI-Core v6.0.0).

The 2026 US Quality Core IG is based on <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU6/">QI-Core v6.0.0</a> and adds USCDI+ Quality V1 guidance and requirements. The 2026 US Quality Core IG retains all artifacts provided by QI-Core v6.0.0; it does not remove QI-Core profiles that are not relevant to USCDI+ Quality. Instead, scope and conformance requirements are described on the <a href="https://fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0/en/uscdiquality.html">USCDI+ Quality Guidance</a> and <a href="https://fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0/en/must-support.html">Must Support</a> pages.

The following pages containing USCDI+ Quality V1 guidance have been **added**:

* <a href="https://fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0/en/general-requirements.html">General Requirements</a>: Documents requirements common to all US Quality Core actors in this guide
* <a href="https://fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0/en/must-support.html">Must Support</a>: Provides additional context on the usage and requirements of MustSupport elements and the USCDI+ Quality flag
* <a href="https://fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0/en/uscdiquality.html">USCDI+ Quality Guidance page</a>: Describes which US Quality Core profiles implement USCDI+ Quality data classes and elements
* <a href="https://fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0/en/relationship-with-uscore-qicore.html">Relationship with US Core and QI-Core</a>: Provides additional context on the relationship of US Quality Core with US Core and QI-Core
* <a href="https://fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0/en/capability-statements.html">Capability Statements</a>: Specifies requirements for servers and clients exchanging USCDI+ Quality data via a standard FHIR RESTful interface

The following QI-Core v6.0.0 content has been **altered**:
* The <a href="https://fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0/en/index.html">Home page</a> has been updated to include background, context, and scope for US Quality Core
* All profiles containing USCDI+ Quality elements have been updated to include USCDI+ Quality flags to indicate elements necessary for USCDI+ Quality V1 implementation. For example, <a href="https://fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0/en/StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-adverseevent.html">AdverseEvent</a> includes a USCDI+ Quality Elements section with six elements relating to USCDI+ Quality
* This <a href="https://fhir.org/guides/onc/us-quality-core/0.5.0/en/changes.html">Change Log</a> has been reset to v0.5.0
* The Table of Contents and associated navigation header have been reorganized similar to US Core to contain dropdowns for Conformance, Guidance, and FHIR Artifacts
* Informational artifacts inherited from QI-Core v6.0.0 supporting measure authoring, including the ModelInfo file and CQL scripts, have been modernized in a manner consistent with later versions of QI-Core. These informational artifacts are outside the scope of conformance expectations of this IG but are retained in this version to support continuity in the CQL tooling ecosystem.

Several other updates have been made to provide the 2026 US Quality Core IG a separate identity from QI-Core, particularly around naming and machine-readable
content.  This includes:
* Updates Implementation Guide metadata to establish a separate identity from QI-Core, resulting in the following changes:
   * Title updated to 2026 US Quality Core
   * Computable name updated to USQualityCore
   * Version reset to v0.5.0
   * Logical id of resources updated to us-quality-core
   * Canonical URL updated to match the ID
   * Removal of (QI-Core) flags
* Updates the ID prefix of all computable artifacts from QICore to USQualityCore
* Reintroduces the Present on Admission extension for Encounter.diagnosis
