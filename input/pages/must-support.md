Because US Quality Core derives from US Core the [requirements on "Must Support" defined in US Core]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscore}}/must-support.html) must be respected.

Like QI-Core, US Quality Core flags USCDI+ Quality elements with a [US Quality Core USCDI+ Quality Extension](StructureDefinition-us-quality-core-uscdi-quality-extension.html) to indicate significance for implementers, instead of applying additional "MustSupport" flags above the inherited US Core "Must Support" flags. This is consistent with US Core's use of the [USCDI Requirement Extension]({{site.data.fhir.ver.uscore}}/StructureDefinition-uscdi-requirement.html) to indicate those requirements specifically applicable to USCDI conformance.

Each US Quality Core profile includes a summary of USCDI+ Quality elements in their *USCDI+ Quality Elements Support Expectations* section (see Figure 1 for an example).

Figure 2 illustrates how the USCDI+ Quality flag is presented in the Formal View of Profile Content, the "Key Elements Table" tab, on the US Quality Core profile pages.

Figure 3 shows the profile's elements and identifies the profile layer where each conformance indicator is first introduced.
